# Osint Report Engine

You should only run this application locally or on a trusted, secure network. **It MUST NOT be exposed to the public internet.**

### Support
This is open source and free. Do not contact me if you can't get it working, I don't have time to provide support for this. Review the code, and open a PR. I do not provide support. Use at your own risk, no warranty

## Osint Report Engine
Osint Report Engine is a web application designed to streamline OSINT research project management, findings tracking, and automated report generation. 

It provides a centralized dashboard to track clients, manage cases across various domain categories (e.g., Corporate Governance, Infrastructure, Dark Web), maintain a global risk library, and automatically generate professional, well-formatted PDF reports and Attestation Letters.

#### Note from Dan
This project was forked and refactored from the kairos-reporting-engine. All kudos should go to Tyler for Open Sourcing an awesome tool. I plan to actively use this for research at my day job. Where possible, I will attempt to integrate new features that Tyler releases for his project, and some of my own as I identify anything useful. If you have any ideas, open an "Issue" with a feature request and I'll consider adding it. 

## Key Features

- **PDF Generation**: Export highly customized, professional PDF reports and formal Attestation Letters powered by Jinja2 and WeasyPrint.

- **Rich Text Editor**: Utilize a built-in rich text editor for writing comprehensive "Steps to Reproduce" and embedding proof-of-concept images.
- **Finding Imports**: This has been removed for now, but plan is to integrate importing findings in JSON format from tools like OSINT Industries.
- **Secure Authentication**: Built-in User Management, Passphrase Hashing (Argon2), and Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP via Google Authenticator/Authy).
- **Risk Library**: Maintain a global library of common vulnerabilities with support for bulk CSV import/export.
- **Production Ready**: Ships with a utility to generate SSL certificates and runs securely on HTTPS port 443 with Streamlit telemetry and dev tools disabled.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- System dependencies for WeasyPrint (e.g., `pango`, `cairo`, `libffi`). 
  - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel python3-cffi libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info`
  - On macOS: `brew install pango cairo libffi`
- `openssl` for generating self-signed certificates.

## Docker

The easiest way to run the application. Docker handles all system dependencies (WeasyPrint, Pango, Cairo, etc.) automatically.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dandrews7396/osint-report-engine.git
cd osint-report-engine
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at: **https://localhost:8443**

On first launch, self-signed SSL certificates are generated automatically. Your browser will show a security warning for the self-signed certificate and you can safely bypass it for local use.

### Data Persistence

Three named Docker volumes keep your data safe across container restarts:

| Volume | Contents |
|---|---|
| `osint-data` | SQLite database (`osint.db`) |
| `osint-reports` | Generated PDF reports |
| `osint-certs` | SSL certificates |

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Stream logs in real time
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the container
docker compose down

# Stop and remove all volumes (Warning: this deletes all data)
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild the image after code changes
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Using Your Own SSL Certificates

You can inject your own certificates into the volume before starting the container:

```bash
docker volume create osint-certs
docker run --rm -v osint-certs:/certs -v $(pwd)/my-certs:/src alpine \
    sh -c "cp /src/cert.pem /certs/cert.pem && cp /src/key.pem /certs/key.pem"
docker compose up -d
```

## Quick Start (without Docker)

To quickly set up and launch the application from scratch, you can copy and paste this entire block into your terminal (assuming you have the prerequisites installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeneBrae93/osint-report-engine.git
cd osint-report-engine
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x generate_cert.sh
./generate_cert.sh
sudo .venv/bin/streamlit run app.py --server.port 443 --server.sslCertFile certs/cert.pem --server.sslKeyFile certs/key.pem --browser.gatherUsageStats false
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Generate SSL Certificates
To run the application securely via HTTPS, first generate your self-signed certificates:
```bash
chmod +x generate_cert.sh
./generate_cert.sh
```

### 2. Start the Application
Because the application bounds to port 443 (a privileged port), start the server with `sudo`:
```bash
sudo .venv/bin/streamlit run --server.port 443 --server.headless true --server.sslCertFile certs/cert.pem --server.sslKeyFile certs/key.pem app.py
```

This will start the local Streamlit server. Navigate your web browser to `https://localhost` to access the application. On your first launch, you will be prompted to create the initial Administrator account.

## Directory Structure

- `app.py`: The lightweight Streamlit router and application entry point.
- `views/`: Modularized Python files containing the UI logic for every page in the application.
- `utils/`: Shared utilities, including authentication singletons and image processing helpers.
- `database/`: Contains SQLite database initialization (`db.py`) and CRUD operations (`operations.py`).
- `parsers/`: Contains parsing scripts for integrating external scanner outputs (e.g., Nessus, Burp Suite).
- `reporting/`: Contains the PDF generation engine (`generator.py`) utilizing WeasyPrint.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML/Markdown templates used for styling and formatting the generated PDF reports.
- `data/`: The default directory where the SQLite database (`osint.db`) and temporary files are stored.
- `reports/`: The default directory where generated PDF reports are saved.
- `certs/`: Directory containing your SSL certificates for HTTPS access.
- `.streamlit/`: Contains the configuration file to enforce port 443 and disable Streamlit analytics.

## Database Note

The application uses a local SQLite database (`data/osint.db`). On the first run, the database and necessary tables will be created automatically.
